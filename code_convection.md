* Stick to pycharm auto-formatting, hotkeys: [Ctrl + Alt + O] for imports and [Ctrl + Alt + L] for spacings

# Static code check

* Code can be merged only if pylint score was not deteriorated

# Pylint usage

* Installing - ```pip install pylint ```
* Usage - ```pylint helpers tests --rcfile=.pylintrc```
